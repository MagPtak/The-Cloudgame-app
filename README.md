# The Cloudgame App

## About

The cloudgame is an application where a user has to pick proper words that match the category indicated in the header. There are three randomly chosen categories: animals, vehicles, and colors. Words chosen by the user are highlighted in a grey font color. The user is able to uncheck the chosen word. Good and bad answers are highlighted in a green and red color, with a proper description (good or bad), after clicking the `Check answers` button. A user can fix his choices or click the `Finish game` button to calculate his final score.
